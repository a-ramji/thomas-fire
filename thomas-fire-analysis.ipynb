    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary goals of this data analysis and visualization. \n",
    "1. Use county-level AQI data to show the **air quality in Santa Barbara County from 2017-2018, highlighting the Thomas Fire**, which occurred in December, 2017.\n",
    "2. Use Landsat and a shapefile of fire perimeters in California to **create a false color image displaying the fire scar from the 2017 Thomas Fire**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights of analysis\n",
    "    - Fetch vector data from an online repository\n",
    "    - Visualize raster data\n",
    "    - Time series analysis\n",
    "    - etc\n",
    "### Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AQI Data\n",
    "- The AQI data I'll be using in my analysis is [Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) data from the [US Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) to visualize the impact on the AQI of the 2017 [Thomas Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire) in Santa Barbara County. \n",
    "- More specifically, I'll be importing county-level AQI data for 2017 and 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 data from Landsat 8 \n",
    "- The second is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite\n",
    "- This data that was accessed and pre-processed in Microsoft's Planetary Computer to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution ([Landsat Collection in MPC](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)) by Professor Carmen Galaz-García ([@carmengg](https://github.com/carmengg) on GitHub)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### California Shapefile\n",
    "- The third dataset is A shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017. The [complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal.](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### References to datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- AQI Data: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata (Accessed October, 2023)\n",
    "- Landsat Data: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2, pre-processed on Microsoft's Planetary Computer by Dr. Carmen Galaz-García (Accessed November, 2023). This file will by in a data folder in my github repo for this project. \n",
    "- CA Shapefile: as mentioned above, the [complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about). I'll be using a local copy of the shapefile in a hidden data folder in this repo. (Accessed November, 2023)"
