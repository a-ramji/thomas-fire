This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook of my analysis and visualization of three key datasets related to the Thomas Fire.

- The first dataset is [Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) data from the [US Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) to visualize the impact on the AQI of the 2017 [Thomas Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire) in Santa Barbara County
- The second is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data that was accessed and pre-processed in Microsoft's Planetary Computer to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution ([Landsat Collection in MPC](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)) by Professor Carmen Galaz-Garcia (@carmengg on GitHub)
- The third dataset is A shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017. The [complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about)
